This was a advanced Ajax class assignment.

The purpose of this assignment was to give a user the ability to create sticky notes as well as edit the notes even after they've been created. As well as to give the user the ability to delete the sticky notes.

To set this up on your own environment. You need to edit the connectionadvanced.php page. You would need to edit the password, username, and database. 

The database must have one table called "notes" and five columns. One auto-incrementing ID column, one title column, one description column, one created_at column, and one updated_at column.
